This is the analysis plan notebook for the pirate project. It keeps tracks of hypotheses we intended to test and different analysis plans we designed to test these hypotheses.

## Hypothesis 1: If Hippocampus(HPC), prefrontal cortex(PFC), and maybe post-parietal cortex (PPC) represent the map, then the representation similarity of the stimuli will be predicted by their distance on the treasure map. 
### Literature
### Analaysis
searchlight and parcellation-based RSA analysis
   

## Hypothesis 2: color or shape will be represented by two orthogonal neural axis
### Literature
### Analaysis
using location on x or y axis as a predictor, look for regions that respond linearly to the location on x or y axis
